# Case-study-of-loan-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms
Prediction on various aspects of loan parameters using different algorithms and choosing the best of all to predict

In this project we are studying various algorithms for classification as well as regression problem

Classification:
The model predicts about the loan_status of people whether they should get the loan or not

Regression:
The model predicts the Loan_Amount which the person should get considering various aspects
